This is the Mini Data Analysis project for STAT545A, it helped me become more familiar with R functions and Github.
There are 3 milestones, more descriptions below. I still need to figure out how to make my files look neater... 

## Milestone 1:
Due Saturday, October 9, 2021 at 22:00 PT
Here we looked at the data and selected 4 datasets, then narrowed it down to 2 and then created 4 research questions.
I picked the apartment buildings dataset because thought it was the most interesting one, though I was also interested in the trees one. I don't have the folder because I messed it up...

## Milestone 2:
Due Tuesday, October 19, 2021 at 22:00 PT.
Here we look at the data more in depth, trying to answer our research questions. I learned more about how to tidy up data!
Name is Deliverable 2, I found that if I keep changing the names it creates conflict, so I will stop doing that. I am using "deliverable" and "milestone" interchangeably. Might fix it at the end.

## Milestone 3:
Due Thursday, October 28, 2021 at 22:00 PT.
This milestone is worth 40, instead of the usual 30. This is because we will also be graded on our GitHub repository. we had to first pick two tasks, had an exercise on modelling, had to use the broom package to get an output from the model, get familiar with the here::here() function, and how to tidy our repository. 
It was hard work!
